This engine was developed and tested on a Windows machine and we developed using Visual Studio.

All the necessary .h and .cpp files are in the main folder along with this readme and the project solution.
Loading the solution in Microsoft Visual Studio and building should build the code successfully.

We took care to try to use c and c++ code that works on any common operating system, but if they have
something similar to windows that requires setting _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNING in order to use them, then
it probably won't work there.
